This folder contains the data used for the annotation experiment described in 
Kalouli, A.-L., A. Buis, L. Real, M. Palmer and V. de Paiva. 2019 (to appear). Explaining Simple Natural Language Inference. Proceedings of the ACL Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW 2019). Florence, Italy. 

Briefly, the experiment concerns the re-annotation of a part of the SICK corpus. The SICK corpus is a dataset for Naturla Language Inference containing pairs which are annotated for their inference relation 
(entailment, contradiction, neutrality) and their relatedness score. The re-annotation was done based on improved guidelines adressing issues discussed in relevant literature and 
also contained the annotators' justifications for their decisions and the so-called *Computational Feasibility* score (CF) representing the estimation of the annotators about
how hard each pair can be processed by an automatic system. The file *SICK_subcorpus_reannotated_with_justifications* contains all pairs that 
were reannotated as part of this experiment, with the detailed annotation, justification and CF score of each annotator. The excel file contains
4 sheets, one for each group of annotators annotating the same instances (3 annotators per group). The annotators are matched to numbers to preserve anonymity.
The file *calibration_pairs_annotated_for_upload* contains the 48 calibration pairs used for the experiment. Here, each pair is assigned a general agreement rate
but also lists the exact annotation given by each annotator.
