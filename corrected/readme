This folder contains the files of the corrected pairs.
The file AeBBnA.xlsx contains the 1513 single-side entailment pairs, which were re-annotated and, when needed, corrected. 
You can find the corrected label and a comment for the correction in the file.

The file oneWordDifference.xlsx contains three different sheets: the 1st sheet contains all one-word difference pairs, 
the 2nd one contains only the pairs which did not get an automatic label from PWN and 
the 3rd sheet contains only those pairs that got a label from PWN. 
In the second and third sheets you can also find the corrections and comments that were made to those pairs.
