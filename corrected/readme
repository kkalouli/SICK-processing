This folder contains the files of the corrected pairs.
The file AeBBnA.xlsx contains the 1513 single-side entailment pairs, which were re-annotated and, when needed, corrected. 
You can find the corrected label and a comment for the correction in the file. You can see the following papers for more discussion
and details: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W17/W17-6915.pdf and http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W17/W17-7205.pdf 

The file oneWordDifference.xlsx contains three different sheets: the 1st sheet contains all one-word difference pairs, 
the 2nd one contains only the pairs which did not get an automatic label from PWN and 
the 3rd sheet contains only those pairs that got a label from PWN. 
In the second and third sheets you can also find the corrections and comments that were made to those pairs. You can see the following
paper for more discussion and details of the correction approach used: http://lrec-conf.org/workshops/lrec2018/W33/summaries/18_W33.html

The file SICK_subset_corrected.csv contains a merged version of the two above files with all pairs that have been corrected so far
(as of 11.02.2019). The file is tab separated with the following format: original id of the pair, sentence A, sentence B, original SICK 
label (from the original annotation of SICK of Marelli et al, 2013) and the last column with our (corrected) label of the pair.
